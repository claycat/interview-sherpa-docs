# Introduction

This is a **side project** developed by [me](https://github.com/claycat) mainly to help **prepare for interviews.**

There are many online materials or github repositories to help prepare for interviews related with software engineer positions.

But I thought that having a platform that could connect the dots and have information saved in a service would be preferrable.

Based on that idea, I created [Interview Sherpa](https://www.interviewsherpa.site/topic)

## Inspirations and Concepts

When you are having an interview for a software engineer position, you tend to get lots of **follow-up questions**

**Interviewer**: *"What is the difference between a thread and a process?"*

**Interviewee**: *"A process is a program under action, and a thread is a unit of execution of a process"*

**Interviewer**: *"What is faster in general? Threads or processes?"*

**Interviewee**: *"Threads are generally faster because of low overhead in context switching and sharing data."*

*Interviewer goes on to ask about context switching and inter process communication...*

To track the path that lead to the question and keep a record on your answers, Interview Sherpa uses **mindmaps**.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your machine, you need to reference two repositories.

1. Frontend Repository [interview-sherpa-fe](https://github.com/claycat/interview-sherpa-fe)
2. Backend Repository [interview-sherpa-be-mono](https://github.com/claycat/interview-sherpa-be-mono) -->

## Thoughts and Challenges

You can visit the [blog](https://claycat.github.io/interview-sherpa-docs/blog) section of this website to take a look at the challenges and thoughts that I wrote while building this.
